# Because this lines starts with "#" it is a comment that python ignores.
# Comments are important for you, the programmer.

# When you are writing code, you can "comment out" a line to keep it from running:

# message = "This line was commented out"
# print(message)

# Uncomment the two lines above and re-run it

# In this example, we have created a variable called "message".

# Look at lines 3 and 4.  We could have skipped creating the variable and just used "print()":

# print("This is a print statement that doesn't use a variable")

# One nice thing about variables is that we can reassign the values easily, like we did on line 6

# TODO: Create a new variable and print it - When you are done, commit into git!
