# ELI5-PYTHON
"ELI5" means "Explain Like I'm Five."

It's a concept that's popular on Reddit.  Here's how they explain the concept:

- "E" is for Explain - merely answering a question is not enough.
- "LI5" means friendly, simplified and layman-accessible explanations - not responses aimed at literal five-year-olds.

What we'd like to do is *explain* not just Python, but programming.  How it works, basic concepts, etc., using Python, which just happens to be a modern, useful, accessible language.

We're not going to assume you've ever tried programming before.
